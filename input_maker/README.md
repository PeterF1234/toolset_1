# A tool to generate and modify input files for Gaussian and ORCA calculations

This tool can be used to automate the extraction of coordinates from the outputs of two major quantum chemical software packages 
to create input files for the other steps of the workflow. It can also manipulate input files to change command line options 
or to convert between the formats of Gaussian and ORCA.

## Requirements

The tool requires a basic Python installation (tested on 3.7+).
